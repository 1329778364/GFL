# Galaxy Learning Framework

Galaxy learning is a federated learning system based on blockchain and PFL(Federated learning framework based on pytorch). 
At present, the PFL part is open-source first, and the blockchain part will be open-source soon. In addition to the traditional federate learning algorithm, PFL also provides a federate learning algorithm based on model distillation. Developers can choose their own federate learning algorithm.
